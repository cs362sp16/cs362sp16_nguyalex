For Assignment 1
I refactored the cards: smithy, village, greatHall, council room, and salvager.
I chose these cards as they are relatively simple in their interactions with the game.
I examined their interactions with the game and passed the appropriate data to their
helper function. Their switch-case clause still exists to call the function.
I made changes to the helper functions as requested.
