Creating a random tester was similar to creating a unit test that repeats itself over and over.
Utilizing forloops allows us to create the cardtest and we just randomized each players hand size and deck size.
Overall it was not that difficult to get 100% coverage however I believe it is hard to find the fault if one
were to be triggered.
