# Implementation

The ‘tests.txt' file is read into the program, then each gcov file is
processed. Depending on the pass/fail status of that test determines
which files should be flagged. From there it run’s it’s suspiciousness test on the 
area of code. It rates them and reports back if the suspiciousness is high. 
A good majority of the code is from examples I found via Google and Github.

Format of tests.txt

    testName    testName.gcov     pass-or-fail

# Instructions

1. Run the test.
2. Run gcov on unittest1.c.
3. Copy unittest1.c.gcov into the /tarantula analysis directory as unittest1.gcov.
4. Repeat steps 1-5 for all tests.
5. Run `make clean` to wipe away previous data.
6. Write your tests.txt file up (including a name, the gcov file for that
   test and the pass/fail status).
7. Run tarantula.py.
