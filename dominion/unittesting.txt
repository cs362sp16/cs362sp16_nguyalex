I am surprised at how much is percentage is covered using my unit tests. I feel like
my tests are inadequate but still we reached a high coverage percent. I believe this
might be a false positive or that the coverage isn't exactly accurate.

Aside from the segfaults I think the testing efforts wasn't as hard as I thought it
would be. It was a bit difficult to get test cases created but once I had a flow going,
test case ideas started to come out naturally.
